# ARGOS satellite telemetry dive analysis

This project processes the raw telemetry from Artic whales tagged with 
satellite transmitters that record depth and duration of their dives.  
Geo-tracking was also done, but handled separately from this analysis.

## Whales and Technology

For this project, the whales tagged were belugas and narwhals around Greenland
and in the Canadian high Artic.  The focus of the research was to investigate
the depth and duration of their dives, as this yields information about their
feeding behaviors. The transmitter technology is from from Wildlife Computers.
